# DropletDetection-YOLOv4

ADD DOI ZENODO

This repository contains the code for the AI-based droplet detection by Inga Burke, Thajeevan Dhayaparan, Ahmed S. Youssef, Katharina Schmidt, and Norbert Kockmann, TU Dortmund University published here: ADD DOI PAPER.
The code can be used to detect droplets automatically based on captured videos with the help of YOLOv4 and Hough Circle. 

## Needed modules (list may not be complete!):

See requirement.txt to create a conda virtual environment.

## yolov4.py (main program)

Open this file to execute the whole workflow as shown below:


The therminal command is given as Command_Terminal.txt file or can be found here:
ABBILDUNG EINFÃœGEN

python yolov4.py -input_path input -output output -confidence 0.6

*input = folder path to input video
*output = folder for detection images and statistical evaluation [if not existing it will be created]
*CS = confidence score; example: 0.6 means 60% confidence

Further inputs are possible; please check the main skript for those. Additionally your piyel-to-micrometer ratio needs to be adapted in the yolov4.py as well as the input image size.
Here it's importatnt that the input image size is a multiple of 32.
